## What's inside
my personal notes and exercises across my learning journey, things I want to try to cement through writing them.

Some of the resources I'll be drawing from: 
* Hands on machine learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition by Aurélien Géron
* ISLR book for statistical learning
* The Hundred Page Machine Learning Book
* Reinforcement Learning Book by Sutton and Barto and Deep Reinforcement Nanodegree from Udacity
