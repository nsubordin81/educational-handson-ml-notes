# Deep Learning For Robotics

## Alpha Go 

It was special that Alpha Go used its own strategy that people hadn't used before to beat a go grandmaster. Deep reinforcement learning taught the world new knowledge about an ancient game. THis is because it wasn't looking at a list of possible moves and then choosing them, it was using learning to optimize the goal of winning. 

Fannic deep RL to perform new tasks. Instead of being precisely programmed in a controlled environment like usual, there is a robot that video tapes itself and learns from successes or failures at accomplishing a given task. Amazon fulfillment centers want to make their robots smarter so they can cut costs. j
